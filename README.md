# hello-world
This is the very first repository I'm creating, whole new world:)

I'm a newbie to either Git or github.
Still, it's quite exciting to challenge myself to the subject!
I may be eager to use the platform for at least a month and (highly likely) for the rest of my life.
Hope we get along well:^)
